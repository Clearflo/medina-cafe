# Fix Deployment Issues

## Problem
The deployment was failing due to filenames with special characters and spaces that are not supported by Netlify.

## Files Renamed
The following files have been renamed to deployment-friendly names:

### Original → New Names
- `Adobe Express - file.png` → `adobe-express-file.png`
- `Adobe Express - sheesha icon.png` → `adobe-express-sheesha-icon.png`
- `Screenshot 2025-06-12 at 5.43.36 PM Medium 2.jpeg` → `screenshot-2025-06-12-medium-2.jpeg`
- `Screenshot 2025-06-12 at 5.43.54 PM Medium.jpeg` → `screenshot-2025-06-12-medium.jpeg`
- `Screenshot 2025-06-12 at 5.45.35 PM Medium.jpeg` → `screenshot-2025-06-12-medium-3.jpeg`
- `medina 2021-08-15.jpeg` → `medina-2021-08-15.jpeg`

## Changes Made
1. Removed spaces and replaced them with hyphens
2. Removed special characters like colons and periods from timestamps
3. Converted all filenames to lowercase for consistency
4. Ensured all filenames use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores

## Next Steps
1. Delete the old files with problematic names
2. Update any code references if needed (none found in codebase)
3. Deploy to Netlify

The renamed files maintain the same content but now have deployment-friendly names that will work with Netlify's deployment system.
